"This film is absolutely awful, but nevertheless, it can be hilarious at times, although this humor is entirely unintentional.<br /><br />The plot was beyond ridiculous. I don't even think a 2 year-old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film-makers tried to slap together into a story. However, on the positive side, some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor. For example, ""Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard!"" It gets worse (and even funnier), but I'll spare you.<br /><br />The acting is generally laughable. Most of the kids' roles are sort of cute, but not very believable. On the other hand, Annie is pretty awful all-around. The adults don't take their roles seriously at all, but this is largely a good thing. If they'd tried to be believable, the film would've been even worse. Which is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />Once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie, there are actually a few standout moments of almost-not-crappiness. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious, though it's an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police. The butler character, while very minor, is a ray of sunlight that almost, but never quite pierces through the gloom.<br /><br />Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain. Nevertheless, there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally. Judged on its good parts alone, the movie would be about a 5; unfortunately, the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1. Thus, I give it a 3.<br /><br />That's being pretty generous, I'd say.",0,this film is absolutely awful but nevertheless it can be hilarious at times although this humor is entirely unintentional the plot was beyond ridiculous i dont even think a yearold would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the filmmakers tried to slap together into a story however on the positive side some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor for example wow lady hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard it gets worse and even funnier but ill spare you the acting is generally laughable most of the kids roles are sort of cute but not very believable on the other hand annie is pretty awful allaround the adults dont take their roles seriously at all but this is largely a good thing if theyd tried to be believable the film wouldve been even worse which is difficult to imagine once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie there are actually a few standout moments of almostnotcrappiness the scene where lady hogbottoms son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious though its an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police the butler character while very minor is a ray of sunlight that almost but never quite pierces through the gloom watching this movie actually caused me physical pain nevertheless there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally judged on its good parts alone the movie would be about a unfortunately the rest of the movie hardly deserves a thus i give it a thats being pretty generous id say
"Well since seeing part's 1 through 3 I can honestly say that they should have NEVER made part 4. Everything from the tacky, and I DO mean tacky score to the really bad acting, I dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds.<br /><br />I mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of Damion, but without him around in this one it's just not the same. Sure by the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continued story line's, but it was a good closure at the end of the third one. Again there was no reason for a part 4. Even if there was they could have done a MUCH better job than this sh*t I had to sit through, lol. There goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again.",0,well since seeing parts through i can honestly say that they should have never made part everything from the tacky and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds i mean parts to kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion but without him around in this one its just not the same sure by the end of part i was getting a little tired of the continued story lines but it was a good closure at the end of the third one again there was no reason for a part even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sht i had to sit through lol there goes an hour and a half of my life ill never see again
"I got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it. The laughs aren't gags here--they're observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!"" I won't give away the plot, which is more than just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since ""While You Were Sleeping."" <br /><br />Steve Carell goes much deeper than he's gone before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've loved in other roles, but they blend to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is lovely as the mother, Juliette Binoche is luminous and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and I'll buy the CD the second it's available.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.",1,i got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it its not the typical romantic comedy i cant remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it the laughs arent gags heretheyre observations laughs of recognition little shocks of oh my god i thought i was the only one who felt that way i wont give away the plot which is more than just guy falls in love with his brothers girlfriend the whole family plays a part in the relationship here probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since while you were sleeping steve carell goes much deeper than hes gone before and for the first time i really liked him the cast is amazing a list of veteran theater actors whom ive loved in other roles but they blend to make a convincing family dianne wiest is lovely as the mother juliette binoche is luminous and hilarious who knew she was funny and even the reviled dane cook gives a warm quiet touching performance the sondre lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition and ill buy the cd the second its available dont miss this one
"This adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester's character. I get the feeling he never even read the book, just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read ""Grumpy, broody, murky past."" He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave. GO AND REREAD THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. AND BY THE WAY: A ""PASSIONATE"" LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO EAT HER FACE.",0,this adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety timothy dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of rochesters character i get the feeling he never even read the book just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read grumpy broody murky past he plays rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy there is no chemistry the only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for charlotte bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave go and reread the book rochester has a personality and by the way a passionate love scene does not mean you have to eat her face
"RÃ¥zone is an awful movie! It is so simple. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in ""krummernes Jul"", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie!<br /><br />Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like ""Film folket""!<br /><br />all in all I think people should see RÃ¥zone. Not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!",0,rÃ¥zone is an awful movie it is so simple it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life just like zappa did many years ago but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors leon are by many still the little girl in krummernes jul and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie even though i consider it a movie you ought to see i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this but i think it can show how it can end if you are letting your child down also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like film folket all in all i think people should see rÃ¥zone not because it is a great film but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it and actually it is in these scenes laura is acting best like the ending where she is holding the gun
"Firstly, this is simply the funniest movie I have ever seen. It incorporates perfectly-timed slapstick, sexual humour, and cleverly-thought-up stand-up. But it goes deeper than that. The Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we don't see that often) that gave me hope that there is love out there;that two people who love each other can work through their adversity; and that such a comedic take on life (something I believe we all should have) can be accepted by the people that really matter. Chris Meloni gives a such a convincing performance as Barry Singer that he should have won an oscar. The film is brilliantly written and I hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future.",1,firstly this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen it incorporates perfectlytimed slapstick sexual humour and cleverlythoughtup standup but it goes deeper than that the souler opposite is an original love story something we dont see that often that gave me hope that there is love out therethat two people who love each other can work through their adversity and that such a comedic take on life something i believe we all should have can be accepted by the people that really matter chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future
"The first hour of the movie was boring as hell. There is no suspense, no action, not even a plot. The movie went no where. I mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film. Overall, the movie wasn't good at all, and I don't recommend it.",0,the first hour of the movie was boring as hell there is no suspense no action not even a plot the movie went no where i mean they could have made the movie in min short film overall the movie wasnt good at all and i dont recommend it
"I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under ""GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS."" (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one.<br /><br />Still, someone in Hollywood said, ""uh oh, better give this to a Gay director or Gay People will make trouble."" So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay he may really be -- he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty.<br /><br />The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre.<br /><br />Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.<br /><br />PAT MORITA as ""THE CHINK"" Okay, there are few name-recognition Asian actors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus didn't tell him.) Pat also doesn't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book he's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He's a randy old goat and he knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they aren't REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?) <br /><br />JOHN HURT as ""THE COUNTESS."" Okay, he's a gay friendly man. But he is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake his head. ""Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student!"" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was BLACK humor, not playful and breezy humor like the book.<br /><br />RAIN PHOENIX as ""Bonanza Jellybean."" No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. ""God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits."" Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? <br /><br />UMA THURMAN as ""Sissy Hankshaw."" This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, or a sway in her walk, to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma doesn't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /><br />This movie is sour and dull. And I accuse YOU, Gus Van Sant!",0,i read tom robbins even cowgirls get the blues as a teenager i loved every word it was sexy funny and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing but when i saw the movie i could not believe what a dull sour joyless piece of junk it was how did this happen i think someone in hollywood read this book and filed it under gay pride women lesbians thats the library of congress subject heading now anyone over who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians any more than star wars is about real space travel the book was obviously and i do mean obviously written by a heterosexual male who loves the idea of lesbians in the nude all the timebut has never really met one still someone in hollywood said uh oh better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble so they handed it to gus van sant nothing against the man but however gay he may really be he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film gus van sant took a straight mans playful fantasy of guiltfree girlgirl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull literalminded lesbian power recruiting poster its like turning an oscar wilde comedy into an arthur miller tragedy not pretty the main clue that gus van sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting his clout allowed him to hire the very best his ignorance of the novels real subtext a straight mans fantasy not a gay pride recruiting postercaused him to make choices that were not only bad but bizarre lets meet the cast of even cowgirls get the blues pat morita as the chink okay there are few namerecognition asian actors and pat morita in happy days was fairly funny but casting him as the chink was wrong wrong wrong pat morita has no idea that the chink is a very funny man gus didnt tell him pat also doesnt seem to know that the chink is well sexy in the book hes not wise old mr miyagi hes more like hugh hefner hes a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the nubile and responsive sissy and bonanza jellybean you see in the book they arent really lesbians do you get that this is a straight mans fantasy yet john hurt as the countess okay hes a gay friendly man but he is a serious shakespearean actor you need someone who is fun and camp for this role for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the countess is tragic and sad i kept expecting paul scofield to wander in all dressed up as thomas more and sadly shake his head now richard you know youve lost your soul entirely for shame my former student and yes john hurt was funny and pretty gay as caligula but that was black humor not playful and breezy humor like the book rain phoenix as bonanza jellybean no talent no training no problem except that in the book bonanza is funny playful cheerful mostly heterosexual and loving in the movie shes sullen passive expressionless and dull as for her taste for women robbins in the book puts it like this god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits uh gus did you read this book uma thurman as sissy hankshaw this is a tough role in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine still a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye or a sway in her walk to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures uma doesnt pull it off probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs uma plays it more like shes in a tv movie about a girl dying of leukemia this movie is sour and dull and i accuse you gus van sant
"I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie, ""The Christmas Box"" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show, hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my ""new"" life. After seeing this movie I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who ""think"" they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child. This movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from start to stop. I had a few calls after the movie, each call the same, ""That was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back"" What a bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither would have EVER made the movie to be so off the mark. I guess that's Hollywood.",0,i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie the christmas box based on the book by richard paul evans i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my new life after seeing this movie i was so disappointed as a mother who lost her only child in november and really knowing the pain i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child it was very unrealistic from start to stop i had a few calls after the movie each call the same that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back what a bunch of bull it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark i guess thats hollywood
"I actually felt bad for the actors in this thing. No doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job. The actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film, it certainly was not. Besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable. The one about the remote control didn't even make any sense. To bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch.<br /><br />I'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I only watched it because of some good comments posted here. They must have been planted by people with ties to the film. You may fool people into watching this, but you can't fool them into liking what they saw.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming. Sure it failed miserably, but it tried. I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble.

"I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even more boring than when I first watched it. I don't understand why it has become such a 'cult classic' when it is so tediously dull. The opening scene looks promising, when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life. After this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses, whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. The makeup is quite good, and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river, and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open. There's not much to wet yourself over though, most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening. There isn't much gore, at least in the Vipco DVD I watched. <br /><br />No, The Incredible Melting Man is not that great at all. I'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it. If you want a TRUE sci-fi/horror cult classic, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!",0,i just watched the incredible melting man for the second time and it was even more boring than when i first watched it i dont understand why it has become such a cult classic when it is so tediously dull the opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life after this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut the makeup is quite good and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic there is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open theres not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you cant really see what is happening there isnt much gore at least in the vipco dvd i watched no the incredible melting man is not that great at all ill give it marks for its cheese factor but thats about it if you want a true scifihorror cult classic watch the deadly spawn instead
"This really doesn't do the blues justice. It starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind anyway) apparently narrating from outer space (?) and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians. Corny as it is, this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary. Afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes, filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland raping the same songs afterwards. This is a good device to show us why the old Blues greats were really so great, but it doesn't make for compelling viewing. There is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play. Nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the Blues. Avoid at all costs.",0,this really doesnt do the blues justice it starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and blind willie mctell or was it blind lemon jefferson someone blind anyway apparently narrating from outer space and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians corny as it is this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes filmed in fake s black and white intercut with the likes of beck and shemekia copeland raping the same songs afterwards this is a good device to show us why the old blues greats were really so great but it doesnt make for compelling viewing there is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments its a shame for wenders scorsese and especially for the blues avoid at all costs

"What of Domino did I hate over everything, and I mean everything, else? Perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like Lucy Lui; who deserves a lot better than this junk; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face. Maybe it's the editing; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they're uttered by people like Kiera Knightly who, if you buy as a bounty hunter, then you'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012.<br /><br />Nobody comes away from Domino with any sort credibility, absolutely nobody at all. It is a painful and misguided experience, taking inspiration from things like Natural Born Killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them. The principal question is: 'Was Domino supposed to be some kind of comedy?' what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she's coming across as 'tough' but really, she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school, attempting to impress her peers. There are things you genuinely don't know how to react to, whether they're supposed to be funny or not. If it is supposed to be a comedy, that begs the next question: 'Is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs?' I don't think so.<br /><br />The film opens with the title card 'Based on a true story........sort of.' If that's supposed to be some sort of post-modernist technique that enables director Tony Scott to bend and manipulate the story of Domino Harvey for his own unique purpose, then you're simply on another planet. Truth is, in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying 'sort of' which I guess is supposed to enable them to make Domino older than she should be and appear on Jerry Springer. Following this, we learn of Domino's relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something; here is the first use of the 'sort of' cop out as in real life she was just four. But if the film had gone by reality's dates then her entire drive would've been born out of the death of........her goldfish.<br /><br />We are then thrust into action with Ed Mosbey (Rourke); Domino (Knightley) herself and would-be love interest Choco (RamÃ­rez). During the scene, an American mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son's life to be spared. What a really misguided opening; presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers, fire off weapons at innocents we don't know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs.<br /><br />The immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads, a feeling of 'No, why are you doing this? Why is this happening?' Bad seeds are planted and, wouldn't you know it, they stick. The film is painful to watch, excruciating even; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in Beverly Hills 90210. Here is another daft post-modernist slant, people playing themselves and that 'sort of' Joker card being played again. Christopher Walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of Robert Downey Jr's Natural Born Killers character.<br /><br />So as the film plods on and Domino is cast into Ed and Choco's gang, purely for her good looks I might add, it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver's registration I.Ds or something that Choco and Domino may have feelings for one another. The problem is, as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character; there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two; the film isn't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place? Does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up? If there is any 'feeling' between Choco and Domino, it exists on such a small, tiny, minimalist scale that you have to ask why it's even included.<br /><br />So then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative-wise. We find out the reason for the fake I.Ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble.

The film's story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up.

I came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film's existence.",0,what of domino did i hate over everything and i mean everything else perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like lucy lui who deserves a lot better than this junk and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light can not directly hit with the same dumb look on her face maybe its the editing that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as theyre uttered by people like kiera knightly who if you buy as a bounty hunter then youll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility absolutely nobody at all it is a painful and misguided experience taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them the principal question is was domino supposed to be some kind of comedy what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think shes coming across as tough but really she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school attempting to impress her peers there are things you genuinely dont know how to react to whether theyre supposed to be funny or not if it is supposed to be a comedy that begs the next question is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs i dont think so the film opens with the title card based on a true storysort of if thats supposed to be some sort of postmodernist technique that enables director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose then youre simply on another planet truth is in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying sort of which i guess is supposed to enable them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer following this we learn of dominos relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something here is the first use of the sort of cop out as in real life she was just four but if the film had gone by realitys dates then her entire drive wouldve been born out of the death ofher goldfish we are then thrust into action with ed mosbey rourke domino knightley herself and wouldbe love interest choco ramÃ­rez during the scene an american mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her sons life to be spared what a really misguided opening presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers fire off weapons at innocents we dont know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads a feeling of no why are you doing this why is this happening bad seeds are planted and wouldnt you know it they stick the film is painful to watch excruciating even as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills here is another daft postmodernist slant people playing themselves and that sort of joker card being played again christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of robert downey jrs natural born killers character so as the film plods on and domino is cast into ed and chocos gang purely for her good looks i might add it appears amidst the plot to do with fake drivers registration ids or something that choco and domino may have feelings for one another the problem is as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two the film isnt a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up if there is any feeling between choco and domino it exists on such a small tiny minimalist scale that you have to ask why its even included so then the film feels the need to crank things up narrativewise we find out the reason for the fake ids that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded he mustve swam really quickly Â– double the speed of the films fasted edit which means something in the

"This unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a POW escape during WW II. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The movie works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual, and literal. The dialogue is ingenious and rings very true.

"Was convincing the world that he didn't exist...<br /><br />This is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people. It's from The Usual Suspects of course in relation to Kaiser Gold..I mean Sose..<br /><br />I got another one like that: -The dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline-<br /><br />This movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making I have seen in a long time. It starts out so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very smart premise. But alas, the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction. And it does so, not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts.<br /><br />Pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut. With enough booze in my brain I would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree. I have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story. And they vary from a story set totally in someones head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming.<br /><br />And that's all jolly swell. But at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And apart from that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like ""Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. And we are not dealing with kind borrowing here, it's a blatant robbery.<br /><br />What ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed. If this movie was a roller-coaster ride, you'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off. There are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you'd be needing a life supply of hurl-buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it. Nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it's going, you get pulled in yet another one.<br /><br />I guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and Ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway, being the next David Lynch or something.<br /><br />1/10 for totally violating one's own work (Ritchy: seek professional help). What could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art-piece, food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debating-clubs. <br /><br />Spare your soul and stomach, avoid at all cost!",0,was convincing the world that he didnt exist this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people its from the usual suspects of course in relation to kaiser goldi mean sose i got another one like that the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline this movie is one of the saddest pieces of filmmaking i have seen in a long time it starts out so well with really fantastic cinematography great acting and a very smart premise but alas the only way this movie is heading is on a course of selfdestruction and it does so not by a single blow but with nagging little wristcuts pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story and they vary from a story set totally in someones head playing chess with himself to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming and thats all jolly swell but at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story and apart from that it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like fight club kill bill casino the usual suspects snatch magnolia and shachnovelle and we are not dealing with kind borrowing here its a blatant robbery what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed if this movie was a rollercoaster ride youd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved that if it was a cocktail youd be needing a life supply of hurlbuckets to work of the nausea after drinking it nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think its going you get pulled in yet another one i guess this story wasnt going anywhere on paper and ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway being the next david lynch or something for totally violating ones own work ritchy seek professional help what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived artpiece food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debatingclubs spare your soul and stomach avoid at all cost

Jessica was not making any sense.. neighter did the ""norwegian priests""<br /><br />The only thing I recognise is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:O gosh)<br /><br />Well.. I guess the people who made this film will never read this comment. but at least I cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration..!<br /><br />I'm proud of my country and I'd love if people in the US were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.<br /><br />That was all..

"There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.<br /><br />Zorro's Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First off, it's a Republic serial in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas but instead by workman-like actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here; as the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call upon.<br /><br />Another big difference is that the setting isn't California. The story here take place in central Mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode, from corny ""twang"" bow sound effects to ludicrous acting. But overall, this represents one of the best Republic serials of all time, and probably the best Zorro one.<br /><br />The plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering., and there's lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits borrowed from this serial.",1,there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades but its a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen zorros fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films first off its a republic serial in chapters and this time zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workmanlike actor reed hadley while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other he does an adequate job helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here as the title implies he has a fighting legion to call upon another big difference is that the setting isnt california the story here take place in central mexico in where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic something zorro and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop dont get me wrong there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode from corny twang bow sound effects to ludicrous acting but overall this represents one of the best republic serials of all time and probably the best zorro one the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering and theres lots of great action fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial
"Two kinds of movies we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago.

"A vastly underrated black comedy, the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a deliciously funny tango and, over all, gives an outstanding performance, unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie. It looks wonderful with great period detail (30's). Lots of lovely swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot.

Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery).

"Must every good story be ""improved"" with added corny Broadway music? Apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, as it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out, and this was a great example of just that... So of course, take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Fetch me a basin.<br /><br />The four stars in my rating come from casting, which I could liken to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of, but then they must go and have them sing (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of Oliver Reed (pardon if I'm mistaken, it's been a while).<br /><br />My biggest complaint I've stated. Why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story? Seldom has this been done to good effect. Generally it ruins the story. It did with this one.

"... to not live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />""A river runs through it"" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point.

Being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun.

"Moron and girlfriend conduct some ritual to resurrect the dead, in attempt to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they do resurrect a dead soul who commences chopping them up with an axe, and the next day some college aged people are telling the story around a campfire. The guy with the axe turns up and starts hacking up the idiots telling the story. The group calls the cops, the cop sees blood splattered all over and thinks it's a mountain lion(!?) and soon after is axed by some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost.<br /><br />Moronic little splatter movie which was filmed in broad daylight but where several characters are carrying flashlights and talking as though it were the middle of the night, and wanting to send up a signal flare to attract attention. One guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other but doesn't bother to load it, then after he finally loads it, he has several opportunities to shoot the killer but doesn't bother to, because that would end the movie too early. Then he throws the gun away! Also detrimental is characters who show no emotion and don't look the least bit concerned after their friends are chopped up into pieces and lousy effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car blown up at the end clearly was a model car) and awful dialogue and some really ugly female nudity doesn't help. And in the end it tries to get away with it's incoherence by saying that it was all the invention of the same college aged people telling campfire stories at the start of this movie. <br /><br />Then the killer turns up for real in the last scene hacks them into pieces.

"Think of a no-budget version of China Syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes John Woo and you'll get 'Power Play.' The idea was good, but the execution, acting, and dialog absolutely killed it, not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie.<br /><br />This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake. The rather cavalier reporter, going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of company execs, is chased around town (along with anyone he speaks to) in order to ""clean"" whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant's faults.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy, coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who may only be attracted to the movie for it's action genre appeal, is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em-ups plus earthquake disaster scenes. All of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've propelled the story. It might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller, and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong-doing afoot.

"I have a six month old baby at home and time to time she fights sleep really bad. One morning she was having a particular difficult time getting to sleep when the doodle bops theme song came on T.V.

"Director Vincenzo Natali first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film ""Elevated"", wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building. His follow-up feature project ""Cube"", released later that year, had a very similar premise, this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps. Both were admirable attempts to take the sci-fi genre a step further, by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation, choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element, how the characters act, react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions. After his exploration into the mainstream with 2002's ""Cypher"", Natali has come back to his bizarre character-film trend to bring us ""Nothing"", his latest, and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of ""What If?""<br /><br />Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) are life-long friends, brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with. Dave, who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature, lives rent-free with Andrew at his ill-located and ill-constructed house, where he often takes advantage of Andrew's neurotic and antisocial mentality. Despite all this, the two misfits are happy together, until one day their deep character flaws, coupled with some astronomically bad luck, land them in the middle of some pretty serious, jail-sentence-worthy trouble. On top of this, they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset, so in the hazy, nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them, they wish that the whole world would just disappear. And it does.<br /><br />Going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film's slow (occasionally too slow) reveal about what's happened to Dave and Andrew, and how they deal with their new reality. Natali's fascination with studying human behavior under duress (ala The Birds) is here in spades, but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers, he's able to break away from the thriller-horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level. It's almost as if he's made the aphoristic opposite of ""Cube"".<br /><br />Of course, the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine. In keeping with fundamental realism, our two anti-heroes' dynamic often becomes antagonistic, sometimes with rather nasty results. Like the ""Desert Island"" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence. In a very twisted, sci-fi way, this is a feel-good flick, with good heart and good intentions.<br /><br />However, there are a few qualms to be had with ""Nothing"". While the two lead actors, Hewlett and Miller, do well with their parts, their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been, considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour. There is some development in the relationship and personalities of Dave and Andrew, some background is given, but ultimately not enough. A generous viewer will sit through the less-engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end, but cynics will probably give up pretty fast.<br /><br />Acting, as mentioned, is adequate, and considering the amount of 'green-screen' work that would've been needed, reasonably convincing. David Hewlett and Andrew Miller, who both wrote co-wrote the screenplay, have been long-time friends of Vincenzo Natali: Hewlett has in fact featured in every film Natali has made. Perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction. Nonetheless, the story could have been a lot more involving. Granted, it is relatively entertaining considering that (no pun intended) nothing really happens, but you get the impression that, in more experienced hands, a lot more could've been done with this premise.<br /><br />In all fairness, ""Nothing"" is an impressive piece of work in many ways. The concept is interesting, the direction is inventive, the script works on a human level and, most of all, it shows a progression in Natali's creative mentality. For fans of his work, this will be a delight, and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time. It's just a shame that the director's fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great, fun film it could have been.",1,director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for characterbased scifi flicks with his short film elevated wherein people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building his followup feature project cube released later that year had a very similar premise this time with people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps both were admirable attempts to take the scifi genre a step further by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element how the characters act react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions after his exploration into the mainstream with s cypher natali has come back to his bizarre characterfilm trend to bring us nothing his latest and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of what if dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller are lifelong friends brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with dave who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature lives rentfree with andrew at his illlocated and illconstructed house where he often takes advantage of andrews neurotic and antisocial mentality despite all this the two misfits are happy together until one day their deep character flaws coupled with some astronomically bad luck land them in the middle of some pretty serious jailsentenceworthy trouble on top of this they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset so in the hazy nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them they wish that the whole world would just disappear and it does going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the films slow occasionally too slow reveal about whats happened to dave and andrew and how they deal with their new reality natalis fascination with studying human behavior under duress ala the birds is here in spades but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers hes able to break away from the thrillerhorror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level its almost as if hes made the aphoristic opposite of cube of course the film is not minutes of laughter and sunshine in keeping with fundamental realism our two antiheroes dynamic often becomes antagonistic sometimes with rather nasty results like the desert island game the film looks at how even best friends when left alone together can fall apart but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence in a very twisted scifi way this is a feelgood flick with good heart and good intentions however there are a few qualms to be had with nothing while the two lead actors hewlett and miller do well with their parts their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew some background is given but ultimately not enough a generous viewer will sit through the lessengaging portions of the film to see it through to the end but cynics will probably give up pretty fast acting as mentioned is adequate and considering the amount of greenscreen work that wouldve been needed reasonably convincing david hewlett and andrew miller who both wrote cowrote the screenplay have been longtime friends of vincenzo natali hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction nonetheless the story could have been a lot more involving granted it is relatively entertaining considering that no pun intended nothing really happens but you get the impression that in more experienced hands a lot more couldve been done with this premise in all fairness nothing is an impressive piece of work in many ways the concept is interesting the direction is inventive the script works on a human level and most of all it shows a progression in natalis creative mentality for fans of his work this will be a delight and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time its just a shame that the directors fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great fun film it could have been

A Spanish-Italian co-production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen on horseback, riding off with his 'man-eating' dog behind him.<br /><br />The townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down. The murders first began around the time Count Yanos' older brother, Count Igor Dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident.<br /><br />Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) that Igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up. Yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred corpse back to life.<br /><br />But of course Igor is still alive (although horribly burned) and stalking and killing the women in the village. We see his char-broiled face appear at various points in the film, so we know he's still alive, making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious.<br /><br />Igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with Yanos over Ivanna, with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that Igor stumbles on to, meeting yet another, final char-broiled end.<br /><br />The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks quite grainy and bad. Other than an even scratchier trailer, no other extras are included. Although it has a nice, creepy Spanish castle and good atmospherics, I found it to be fairly boring and predictable, with no excitement or mystery, whatsoever. <br /><br />3 out of 10.",0,aka blood castle or scream of the demon spoiler this was a drivein feature cobilled with the velvet vampire a spanishitalian coproduction where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named yanos dalmar is seen on horseback riding off with his maneating dog behind him the townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down the murders first began around the time count yanos older brother count igor dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident then a woman ivanna erna schuer that igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells yanos wants to bring igors charred corpse back to life but of course igor is still alive although horribly burned and stalking and killing the women in the village we see his charbroiled face appear at various points in the film so we know hes still alive making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with yanos over ivanna with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that igor stumbles on to meeting yet another final charbroiled end the retromedia dvd is taken from a vhs source and looks quite grainy and bad other than an even scratchier trailer no other extras are included although it has a nice creepy spanish castle and good atmospherics i found it to be fairly boring and predictable with no excitement or mystery whatsoever out of

"Despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of most uninspiring Disney films I've seen, and I don't slam Disney films very often. Spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured, either by the cavalry or by Indians, both of which try to ""break"" him. Spirit ends up forming a bond with the Indian, and that, in a nutshell, is the story. With exception to the beautiful animation of the horses, neither I or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film. It's ironic that it's titled ""Spirit"", as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of. An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this film is rated G, you will still probably have to end up explaining what ""breaking a horse"" means to your five year old.

"In addition to his ""Tarzan"" series, the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs did write many other books, although, aside from the popular ""At the Earth's Core"", few of these have been filmed. One exception is the novel entitled ""The Lad and the Lion"", brought to the screen as ""The Lion Man"" (1936), an over-talkative, static, old-hat, slow-moving and rather dull movie, despite being filmed on real desert locations. Actually ""movie"" is the wrong word. The narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks. For instance, at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. Even more frustrating for the keen movie fan, are the characters who make an impression of sorts (like the lass who plies Hall with drugged wine) but are enacted by players who are not credited! The credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns. One exception is Australian actress Finis Barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young Master Fairy. Admittedly, most of the cast are saddled with atrocious King James dialogue which has to be heard to be believed! But the way to play this rubbish is tongue-in-cheek, a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's roster of no-talent players. Maybe director J.P. McCarthy scotched that idea. Anyway, it's sad to see the lovely Kathleen Burke forced to trade lines with the likes of Richard Carlyle (her dad) and Jon Hall (her suitor).

"Ladies and Gentlemen,please don't get fooled by ""A Stanley Kubrick"" film tag.This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.Horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.In Shining,there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive,foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost,lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.There is not much to be said of a bald,colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.It cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.",0,ladies and gentlemenplease dont get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tagthis is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever madehorror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror filmin shiningthere is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naivefoolish attempt made to create chilling horroreveryone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from realityall that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good tooa word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lostlazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to dothere is not much to be said of a baldcolored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actorno need to blame the bad weather for the tragedyit can not be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes
"Georgia Rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp, ""what?"" out loud at least 7-10 times throughout its grueling two hour course.<br /><br />Advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as the matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan as the rebellious, over- sexed, scantily clad grand-daughter, the viewer thinks this will be a clichÃ©, light, chick-flick about growing up and coming together as a family.<br /><br />Talk about false advertisement at it worst.<br /><br />After many shots of animals doing ""funny"" things in the background of ""pivotal"" scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor's office weekly to have her diaper changed, or the fact that this movie is actually about Lindsay Lohan's character being sexually abused by her step-father, Georgia Rule creates its own genre of cinema : The ungrounded, horribly acted, inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward, surreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama/comedy, then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. And so on.<br /><br />The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that Georgia Rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation. Say that the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn, belly laughs and comedy would ensue, with all of the characters' reactions being that of fake, lifeless, human beings pretending to care. <br /><br />Throw in a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, most non-dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script, along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy, too-tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he, as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you've got Georgia Rule.<br /><br />I found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc..who have a lot more talent and aren't getting noticed.<br /><br />Don't see this movie : my rule. <br /><br />And if you must, get sufficiently drunk before hand.",0,georgia rule has got to be one of if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp what out loud at least times throughout its grueling two hour course advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women jane fonda as the matriarch felicity huffman as her daughter and lindsay lohan as the rebellious over sexed scantily clad granddaughter the viewer thinks this will be a clichÃ© light chickflick about growing up and coming together as a family talk about false advertisement at it worst after many shots of animals doing funny things in the background of pivotal scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctors office weekly to have her diaper changed or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohans character being sexually abused by her stepfather georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema the ungrounded horribly acted inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward surreal strange way if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a dramacomedy then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums sideways junebug and so on and so on the only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation say that the movie the year old virgin was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn belly laughs and comedy would ensue with all of the characters reactions being that of fake lifeless human beings pretending to care throw in a yellow parakeet dermot mulroney as the flattest most nondimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy tootanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and youve got georgia rule i found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers screenwriters actors editors etcwho have a lot more talent and arent getting noticed dont see this movie my rule and if you must get sufficiently drunk before hand
"I have never seen a Barbara Steele movie that I haven't liked, and have always been a sucker for a good haunted-house story (especially for such wonderful pictures as ""The Legend of Hell House"" and the original versions of ""The Haunting"" and ""House on Haunted Hill""), so I had a feeling that ""Castle of Blood"" would be right up my alley. And boy, was it ever! This French-Italian coproduction, while perhaps not the classic that Steele's first horror film, ""Black Sunday,"" remains to this day, is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric, chilling entry in the spook genre. Filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma. The film concerns a journalist who bets one Lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in Blackwood's castle on the night of All Saints Day, when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate. The viewer gets to see these deaths, and they ARE pretty horrible, for the most part. The film does indeed send shivers up the viewer's spine, and in the uncut DVD that I just watched--thanks to the fine folks at Synapse--even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie; her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre. Her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable. Not for nothing has she been called ""The Queen of Horror.""",1,i have never seen a barbara steele movie that i havent liked and have always been a sucker for a good hauntedhouse story especially for such wonderful pictures as the legend of hell house and the original versions of the haunting and house on haunted hill so i had a feeling that castle of blood would be right up my alley and boy was it ever this frenchitalian coproduction while perhaps not the classic that steeles first horror film black sunday remains to this day is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric chilling entry in the spook genre filmed in black and white it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma the film concerns a journalist who bets one lord blackwood and an author named edgar allen poe that he can spend the night in blackwoods castle on the night of all saints day when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate the viewer gets to see these deaths and they are pretty horrible for the most part the film does indeed send shivers up the viewers spine and in the uncut dvd that i just watchedthanks to the fine folks at synapseeven features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism and barbara is wonderful in this movie her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable not for nothing has she been called the queen of horror
"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had extensive (separate) film careers before they were eventually teamed. For many of Ollie's pre-Stan films, he was billed on screen as Babe Hardy ... and throughout his adult life, Hardy was known to his friends as 'Babe'. While touring postwar Britain with Laurel in a music-hall act for Bernard Delfont, Hardy gave an interview to journalist John McCabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname: early in his acting career, Hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed Hardy's plump cheeks (the ones on his face) and said 'Nice baby!' Hardy's workmates started crying him 'Babe', and the nickname stuck.<br /><br />Although much of Hardy's pre-Laurel work is very interesting -- notably his comedy roles in support of Larry Semon and the Chaplin imitator Billy West -- his teamwork with Billy Ruge (who?) in a series of low-budget shorts for the Vim Comedy Film Company is very dire indeed. Hardy and Ruge were given the screen names Plump and Runt: names which are unpleasant in their own right, but made worse because Ruge (although shorter than Hardy) isn't especially a runt. Seen here, Hardy looks much as he does in his early Hal Roach films with Laurel ... but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache.<br /><br />'One Too Many', an absolutely typical Plunt and Runt epic, is direly unfunny ... and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as 'That's My Wife', one of Laurel and Hardy's most hilarious films. Plump (Hardy) is the star boarder in a rooming-house run by a tall gawky landlady. Runt (Ruge) is the porter. Plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle John, whose dosh he expects to inherit. His uncle is coming to see him and to meet Plump's wife and baby. There's only one problem: Plump hasn't got a wife and baby. He's been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man. Now, of course, Plump expects Runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice. Of course, the results are disastrous. It would be nice if those disastrous results were funny, but they aren't. Most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick, with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs.<br /><br />SPOILERS COMING. Vim director Will Louis (who?) shows no instinct for camera framing: the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than Hardy, and Louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame. This could be funny if done on purpose, but it's merely inept. At one point in this bad comedy, an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as Runt approaches a black laundress. 'Surely they wouldn't stoop THAT low for a laugh,' I thought. But they do. Runt steals the woman's black infant and tries to fob this off as Plump's progeny.<br /><br />Somehow, Plump acquires an infant's cot, but he still hasn't got a baby. With Uncle John coming up the stairs, Plump conscripts Runt for babyhood. This gag might just possibly have worked with a midget, or even with a truly runt-sized actor such as Chester Conklin, but Billy Ruge is only slightly below average height. Ruge's impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny, and Uncle John would have to be a complete moron to fall for it. Amazingly, he does!<br /><br />The most notable aspect of 'One Too Many' is a brief appearance -- apparently her only-ever film appearance -- by Madelyn Saloshin, Oliver Hardy's first wife. The marriage was not a happy one, although Hardy's marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of Stan Laurel's. <br /><br />Only one thing in this movie impressed me. There is a very brief flashback sequence, with Hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty. In 1916, there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks: the one shown here is done gracefully and simply. Too bad this movie has no other merits. 'One Too Many' is definitely one film too many on Oliver Hardy's CV, and I'll rate this movie just one point out of 10. Laurel and Hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately.",0,stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive separate film careers before they were eventually teamed for many of ollies prestan films he was billed on screen as babe hardy and throughout his adult life hardy was known to his friends as babe while touring postwar britain with laurel in a musichall act for bernard delfont hardy gave an interview to journalist john mccabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname early in his acting career hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed hardys plump cheeks the ones on his face and said nice baby hardys workmates started crying him babe and the nickname stuck although much of hardys prelaurel work is very interesting notably his comedy roles in support of larry semon and the chaplin imitator billy west his teamwork with billy ruge who in a series of lowbudget shorts for the vim comedy film company is very dire indeed hardy and ruge were given the screen names plump and runt names which are unpleasant in their own right but made worse because ruge although shorter than hardy isnt especially a runt seen here hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache one too many an absolutely typical plunt and runt epic is direly unfunny and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as thats my wife one of laurel and hardys most hilarious films plump hardy is the star boarder in a roominghouse run by a tall gawky landlady runt ruge is the porter plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john whose dosh he expects to inherit his uncle is coming to see him and to meet plumps wife and baby theres only one problem plump hasnt got a wife and baby hes been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man now of course plump expects runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice of course the results are disastrous it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny but they arent most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs spoilers coming vim director will louis who shows no instinct for camera framing the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than hardy and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame this could be funny if done on purpose but its merely inept at one point in this bad comedy an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as runt approaches a black laundress surely they wouldnt stoop that low for a laugh i thought but they do runt steals the womans black infant and tries to fob this off as plumps progeny somehow plump acquires an infants cot but he still hasnt got a baby with uncle john coming up the stairs plump conscripts runt for babyhood this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget or even with a truly runtsized actor such as chester conklin but billy ruge is only slightly below average height ruges impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it amazingly he does the most notable aspect of one too many is a brief appearance apparently her onlyever film appearance by madelyn saloshin oliver hardys first wife the marriage was not a happy one although hardys marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of stan laurels only one thing in this movie impressed me there is a very brief flashback sequence with hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty in there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks the one shown here is done gracefully and simply too bad this movie has no other merits one too many is definitely one film too many on oliver hardys cv and ill rate this movie just one point out of laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately
"For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was pretty good. It's another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky (""Snatch,"" ""Sexy Beast,"" etc.). It's not wild like ""Snatch"" but it's interesting and it has some rough characters.<br /><br />It also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian ""mail order bride"" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises.<br /><br />Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film and well-acted. Kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face.",1,for a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good its another one of these modernday british crime films that are quirky snatch sexy beast etc its not wild like snatch but its interesting and it has some rough characters it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show not late has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the firsttime viewer basically its about a lowkey british male who sends away for a russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two russian male friends providing a couple of big surprises ben chapin and nicole kidman costar and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidmans russian cohorts this is a different kind of film and wellacted kidman once again proves shes far more than just a beautiful face
"Just kidding.<br /><br />Seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in New York City, Jon Voight is young optimist Cowboy (almost Forest Gump-like) Joe Buck from Texas. It does not take long for the Big Apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon Joe is the target of both the coldness of New Yorkers and cons from its street-thugs. Given his pure heart, he takes pity on one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive.<br /><br />While Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion. It is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie-vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying Warhol-party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra-urban New York City. The film crams Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between, thereby emphasizing his out-of-place position. We feel for his struggle to fit in, but also to merely get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. I imagine this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead character and, to an extent, the Crocodile Dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour - a contrast between country-cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitans. Very compelling and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend.<br /><br />8.5/10",1,just kidding seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city jon voight is young optimist cowboy almost forest gumplike joe buck from texas it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its streetthugs given his pure heart he takes pity on one of these thugs ratso rizzo dustin hoffman and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippievibe of the late s with its mandatory dizzying warholparty cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultraurban new york city the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between thereby emphasizing his outofplace position we feel for his struggle to fit in but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its purehearted and outofplace lead character and to an extent the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour a contrast between countrycowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend

"There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie's trailer. I am trying to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local movies, but I can't help but support the backlash against this movie. It is slow, boring and bordering on pointless. Even the ""almost nice and believable moments"" were immediately undercut by painful clichÃ©s and bad acting. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were only passable in this movie. It felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic TV Soap, then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. The Leap Years should come with an RA rating (Rated Awful) but it hasn't changed my faith in local movies. More good films will come, so long as more films like these don't get made.",0,there are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movies trailer i am trying to be balanced in my review because i strongly support local movies but i cant help but support the backlash against this movie it is slow boring and bordering on pointless even the almost nice and believable moments were immediately undercut by painful clichÃ©s and bad acting vernetta lopez and wong li lin whom i usually love were only passable in this movie it felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic tv soap then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen the leap years should come with an ra rating rated awful but it hasnt changed my faith in local movies more good films will come so long as more films like these dont get made
"I saw ""An American in Paris"" on its first release when I was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway. I went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times I have seen it since, both in the cinema and on TV. It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The supporting cast of Oscar Levant (as quirky as ever), Georges Guetary (why didn't he make more movies ?) and Nina Foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. The closing ballet, superbly choreographed to the title music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are ""It's Very Clear"" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and ""I Got Rhythm"" (the kids of Paris joining Gene Kelly in ""Une Chanson Americaine""). If you love Paris, see this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see it. But see it !",1,i saw an american in paris on its f
